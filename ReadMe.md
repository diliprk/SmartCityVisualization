# Smart City Visualization
 This repository is a collection of data wrangling, analytics and visualization works that i did for the project work titled *Vehicle Traffic Analysis for Smart Street Lighting*, a Media Arts and Design project for [HBK Saar](http://www.xmlab.org/projects/projektbeschreibung/article/smart-city-visualization/) in cooperation with the University of Saarland. This is an IoT project where a LoRa end node was built with a SHARP IR Sensor to count vehicle traffic on a street.
